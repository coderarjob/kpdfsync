# TASKS                                                                 Estimated       Actual
[X] String comparison algorithm, that can analyze the degree of match. 
    So that minor differences between the pattern and the read text 
    from pdf files are handled.

[X] Use PDFClown library to highlight the text which matches the most
    with the highlighted text from My Clippings file.

[X] Parse the 'My Clippings.txt' file.

# BUGS:
[ ] The string matching algo is too simple, and gives wrong match 
    percentage, if the strings being compared differ in the number 
    of non-whitespace characters. The two indexes get out of sync 
    at the first mismatch and never recover. 
    Example:
    PDF text      = 123 56 789
    Clipping text = 123 456 789
    % match       = 3/8          (Wrong)
    % match       = 7/8          (What is expected)

[ ] Related to the above bug, we are highlighting more characters - 
    by that many characters as the diffence in the number of 
    characters, between the text read from the PDF and the pattern 
    read from the clippings file.
    The algorithm matches character by character, the pattern and the
    text from the pdf. The matching and thus the highlighting is as 
    long as the shortest string. If the pattern is shorter, the length
    of the highlight is that. However we humans can see the end of the
    match should have ended before.
    Example:
    PDF text      = 12 67 89
    Clipping text = 12 45 67
    Highlighting  = 12 67 89     (Wrong, Because length of Clipping text
                                  is 8)
    Highlighting  = 12 67        (Expected, Much more accepatble 
                                  highlighting)

[ ] For some PDF files, org.pdfclown.tools.TextExtractor.extract() is returning null.
    This is seen with the Concrete Mathematics original PDF file.

[ ] Highlight is not visible on the output PDF file. This was seen on the Concrete Mathematics
    cropped PDF file.
